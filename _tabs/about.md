## Why “Byakugan”
Byakugan exemplifies the ability to see everything, pierce
illusions, and read the battlefield with clarity.

This takes that spirit
into the digital realm: build and run tools that let you see and verify for
yourself, store your data privately, and act with sovereignty.

## Ethos
- Verify, don’t outsource
- Privacy by default, sharing by choice
- Minimize trusted third parties
- Prefer simple, auditable systems over glossy platforms
- Operate independently

## Focus
- Running Bitcoin like a sovereign operator: full nodes, wallets, and infra
- Private-by-design workflows: Tor, VPN, PGP, minimal metadata leakage
- Pragmatic security: backups, key hygiene, service isolation, update discipline
- Clean ops: lightweight stacks, low bloat, transparent configs
- Clear trade-offs: what you gain, what you risk, and how to decide

## What you’ll find here
- Step-by-step guides you can reproduce and audit
- Opinionated minimalism (less daemons, fewer knobs, more clarity)
- Policy and network behavior explained in plain language
- Templates: configs, systemd units, docker-compose files
- Troubleshooting notes from real deployments

## What you won’t find
- Custodial shortcuts or “cloud convenience” that compromises sovereignty
- Hype, affiliate pushes, or “one-click” black boxes
- Unverified claims or copy-paste commands without context

## Operating principles
- Write for reproducibility: document versions, commands, and checks
- Raw and unfiltered opinions

## The stance on Bitcoin
Bitcoin is the tool; sovereignty is the goal. A node is your lens and your
shield. Build for the world we have: miners, mempools, policy, and incentives.
Choose clients, settings, and networks that preserve privacy and control.

## Who this is for
- Builders who want to understand and own their stack
- Practitioners who prefer lean, stable systems
- Learners who value clear trade-offs and practical security
- Anyone choosing to read brutally honest pieces

## Contribute or say hello
Byakugan is a living notebook. If you spot errors, want a deeper dive, or have
anything worth sharing, reach out and propose an improvement or take the initiative and submit a pull request. The mission is
simple: see clearly, store privately, act intentionally—and help others do the
same.

## Credits
This work stands on the shoulders of the free and open-source community—
node operators, wallet devs, privacy researchers, and patient educators who
publish their methods. Where guides borrow or build upon prior art, sources are
credited inline.

## Disclaimer
Nothing here is financial advice. You are responsible for your own due
diligence, local laws, and maintenance. Test in safe environments, keep
good backups, and verify before you trust.
